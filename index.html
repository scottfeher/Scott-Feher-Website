            <p>For this course I have found it both satisfying and challenging to complete this process. For the Typography task I have enjoyed creating and exploring the typographical systems, this is something I have not
                looked at before and will be very useful for the future because I can bare in mind these different types and use them to my advantage. I found setting up the typography page easy as well for my website and
                enjoyed explaining why I have designed them the way I have. For the UX task I enjoyed laying out the website itself and struggled with knowing what I could do for it, I have never designed a website before so
                this was interesting for me to do as well as useful for the future if I need to again. This means I will also have a better understanding of what I am doing and how to properly layout a wesbite. The coding
                really challenged me mentally when doing the worksheets but was good for me as it forced me to learn about html and css which I have never done before, this ultimately made it easier for me to create my website
                as well. The coding will also be very useful for the future because it taught me basics like how to even set up a webpage and how to act from there. For my CARP page I liked the brief of designing for someone
                because in the future that is very much a job that I will have to do if I follow that profession, also further justifying why I have made something the way it is is a very useful practice in the design world.
                Using CARP in particular is useful because it makes you sit and think about what you are doing and almost guides you to design something in a more thoughtful way. All of these skills are something that I will
                develop throughout university and hopefully in the future as a profession as well.
