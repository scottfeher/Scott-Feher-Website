                <p>This first idea for my main page is similar to how my website has turned out aside from where the image of me
                    has been placed on my webpage itself. The reason why it has been designed in this manner initially is because
                    I wanted an easy-to-use website with clear signs and symbols to will direct you to each webpage. My name is
                    at the top of the screen as so to indicate immediately to the user who's website it is.
                </p>

                style="width:325px;height:232px">
                <p>This next image is my Typography page that I explored ideas for, this isn't too far from what I actually made 
                    but in my final design for my actual website I have instead made it so that instead of the images and the text
                    being next to each other it is a scroll design down the page instead. The reason why I made it that design in the
                    original design is because it is then easy to look at and can flip between each image and explanation with ease
                    as the viewer. I realised this design is limited though depedning what device you're on so I thought it would
                    be more effective if instead it was adjusted to go downwards.

                style="width:325px;height:232px">
                <p>This image is my CARP Page and is once again not too different from what I finally decided to do. I instead changed
                    my design to be cascading down the page instead of next to each other as this gives the page more room to show the
                    posters in their own sections rather than jumbled all into one. The reason why I originally designed it this way
                    was once again because it gives ease to the viewer with clear expalanations beneath each one.

                style="width:325px;height:232px">
                <p>This next idea is how my UX page was going to turn out, as you can see I originally show it being with the photos
                    of the wireframes in a certain order with descriptions above. How my actual page turned out is different to this
                    with my images cascading down the page with descriptions beneath and relevant screenshots being taken and placed
                    next to them to show their clear difference. I have designed it this way because it's easily legible and clear what
                    page I am talking about with a strategy and scope paragraph at the bottom as well.

                style="width:325px;height:232px">
                <p>This page is my coding page in it's initial wireframe design, it is shown to having three images next to each other
                    presumably of each webpage. I have instead adjusted this in my final design by craeting videos instead of screenshots and
                    changing the layout with a reflection paragraph beneath each one.

                <p>My portfolio website contains all of the information to be handed in for the first semester of Graphic
                    and Web Design whilst studying at UWE. My website is being targeted at people who are my age such as 
                    peers of the class, as well as the people who are marking my work; Mic Palmer, Mary Jackson. The goals of this 
                    website are to make a friendly and usable interface that anyone can use and direct themselves easily around 
                    with clear titles/headings that allow efficient access to each section. Another goal is to demonstrate a clear 
                    understanding of basic usage of website coding as well as showing what weâ€™ve been asked to do. My website will 
                    function using GitHub and being coded on Visual Studio Code, this is using HTML and CSS to style the websites, it 
                    should function after being made into a repository on GitHub. It functions by having a main page and then links 
                    that lead to another subpage that shows the relevant work I have completed, as well as this I have text you can 
                    press that has hyperlinks in it that go to other pages such as the Coding pages. The requirements I have for 
                    this website is the work that I have been set, which can be put into four sections; Typography page, Coding page, 
                    UX page and the CARP Posters page, as well as this I have been required to make sure that there is a constant clear 
                    scheme between the pages and the layouts are similar to establish continuity. I have been asked to furthermore add 
                    in reflection paragraphs for the work I have provided as an explanation as to why I have done my work the way I 
                    have done it given the task provided. </p>
