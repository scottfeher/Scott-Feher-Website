                <p>This first idea for my main page is similar to how my website has turned out aside from where the image of me
                    has been placed on my webpage itself. The reason why it has been designed in this manner initially is because
                    I wanted an easy-to-use website with clear signs and symbols to will direct you to each webpage. My name is
                    at the top of the screen as so to indicate immediately to the user who's website it is.

                <p>My portfolio website contains all of the information to be handed in for the first semester of Graphic
                    and Web Design whilst studying at UWE. My website is being targeted at people who are my age such as 
                    peers of the class, as well as the people who are marking my work; Mic Palmer, Mary Jackson. The goals of this 
                    website are to make a friendly and usable interface that anyone can use and direct themselves easily around 
                    with clear titles/headings that allow efficient access to each section. Another goal is to demonstrate a clear 
                    understanding of basic usage of website coding as well as showing what weâ€™ve been asked to do. My website will 
                    function using GitHub and being coded on Visual Studio Code, this is using HTML and CSS to style the websites, it 
                    should function after being made into a repository on GitHub. It functions by having a main page and then links 
                    that lead to another subpage that shows the relevant work I have completed, as well as this I have text you can 
                    press that has hyperlinks in it that go to other pages such as the Coding pages. The requirements I have for 
                    this website is the work that I have been set, which can be put into four sections; Typography page, Coding page, 
                    UX page and the CARP Posters page, as well as this I have been required to make sure that there is a constant clear 
                    scheme between the pages and the layouts are similar to establish continuity. I have been asked to furthermore add 
                    in reflection paragraphs for the work I have provided as an explanation as to why I have done my work the way I 
                    have done it given the task provided. </p>
