            <h4>CARP TASK</h4>
            <h8~>This is where i keep my CARP Posters, this stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition,
                Proximity.</h8>

        
             <div class="carp-section1-heading">
                <p>CARP POSTER 1</p> 
             </div>
            <p>This is my favourite CARP poster that I have made whilst doing this task, I have made sure to explore the 4 areas/meanings of CARP;</p>
               <p>Contrast - There is contrast in this poster between the True/False words as the backgrounds behind the words themselves are different
                colours flipping between white and red. The reason why I have done this is because the colours have connotations of the words themselves
                with 'true' being a pure word so colours like white can represent it. Whereas red can represent 'false' as being dishonest. There is
                also contrast between the text itself with the more important text being shown as bigger and bolder in comparison to more unimportant
                information being smaller.</p> 
                <p>Alignment - The alignment of my page is off-centre but uses the whitespace on the left side as a bigger area to fit more information
                within it. Text such as the website link is shown following down the line in the page and creates an interesting composition for the
                viewer creating a need to look and turn sideways. All of the text is aligned against a wall, whether that being the wall of a letter or
                the wall of a line or even the wall of the page itself.</p>
                <p>Repetition - The repetition that I have created for this poster would be the size and style of the text, keeping the font the same
                throughout as well as making the font similar to that of the logo being shown in the bottom left. The colours that are show in the logo are
                also clearly repeated on the poster to insinuate continuity from the logo to the design.</p>
                <p>Proximity - The whitespace I have used on the left side as well as the right side is a clear use of proximity because it allows the text
                to be viewed without cramping all around it from the other text. This whitespace is also used to present to whoever is viewing the importance
                of some parts of the poster in comparison to others, there is more white-space on the right than the left but this is also due to less space being
                available.</p>

            <div class="carp-section1-heading">
                <p>CARP POSTER 2</p>
            </div>
            <p>This CARP poster is the poster I made next and explored CARP with;</p>
            <p>Contrast - The contrast in this poster can be seen between the background of the page and the foreground with a tint over it as if it is far away.
                There is also a contrast between the two words 'true' and 'false' with false being made white and put in front of the red background once again to
            represent the connotations of the words. This contrast is first represented by the logo that has been shown and then finally reflected by what is actually
            on my poster</p>
            <p>Alignment - The alignment on this poster shows the text being stuck to each wall as well as the images/logo that has been put upon it. As well as
                this there is a cascading alignment of the text going downwards which causes the viewer to follow the page downwards potentially onto other information
                that could be of relevance. The text on the left is in black which could naturally guide the eye from the title at the top immediately left and then
                back right once read.
            </p>
            <p>Repetition - The repetition I have demonstrated on here is shown in the background where the words 'true/false' are repeated over and over, this is so
                that even at a first glance the name of the festival is drilled into the head of the viewer subconsciously without them even realising. There is also repetition
                shown in colours which match up with the logo, and the colour scheme is repeated throughout where it can.
            </p>
            <p>Proximity - There is more whitespace in this poster than others and that is due to the background because there is enough where you notice the repetition
                of the festival name in the background but not so much that it looks empty. This once again links back to that subtlety of noticing the background without
                actually noticing the background. There is also whitespace next to the date of the festival to create good composition and flow of the rest of the text
                so it is not all just bundled together.
            </p>

            <div class="carp-section1-heading">
                <p>CARP POSTER 3</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is my second favourite poster I made, this also reflects CARP;
                </p>
            <p>Contrast - The contrast in this is mainly clear just using the colours, generally being used for smaller text so that it is easier to read for the person who is
                viewing it. I have also done contrast once again in colours to represent the connotations of certain words like 'true' and 'false'.
                This is so as soon as it is viewed there is a clear link that will go off in someones head between this.
            </p>
            <p>Alignment - The alignment for this poster is with the two bars of 'true' and 'false' as they are in the same place with all of the other information being viewed around
                it. There is also alignment of the text where they are sticking to the walls on the side and none of them being centered. This is because the only text that is centered
                is the name of the festival itself so deems it more important and more eye-catching.
            </p>
            <p>Repetition - The main repetition that can be seen is in the words 'true/false' themselves because they are repeated 3 times throughout the page. This is done on purpose
                so that it is drilled into the head of the viewer and there is a high chance that whatever text that they view next will have those words within. There is also repetition
                of the colour scheme being used throughout for continuity.
            </p>
            <p>Proximity - The whitespace in this poster is represented by black as I have used white and this is an opposing colour. The space furthermore is important, but there isn't
                as much space used like the other posters, however I have made sure not to make the page look jumbled with words by making fonts bigger/smaller than others so that they can
                be placed correctly and smaller text will not coincide with larger text creating more space in other areas. This creates a more even look
                throughout.
            </p>
