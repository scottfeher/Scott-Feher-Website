        <div class="type-section1">
           
            <div class="section1_item1">
                <img src="Axial Typographical System2-01.png" 
            style="width:400px;height:400px;">
                <p>Axial Typographical System</p>
                <p>This type of typographical system is made using
                    axis and vertical/diagonal lines and text. There is also symmetry used
                    during the Axial system, you can see I have reflected this system
                    in my design since there is clear use of diagonal and asymmetrical text
                    combined with lines for example the word 'Arnolfini' being incorporated
                    with the design itself and the words beneath following that line.
                </p>

            <div class="section1-item2"> 
                <img src="radial typographical system2-01.png"
            style="width:400px;height:400px;">
                <p>Radial Typographical System</p>
                <p>This type of typographical system is made using
                    a central focus point and then from there the design radiates
                    outwards from there, this is generally in a circle pattern. You can see
                    in my work that I have reflected this by expanding the text outwards
                    from the middle of the circles. The one on the bottom left especially
                    shows this since the text itself isnt as important as the bigger bolder
                    text shown above but allows it to have more layers, creating a more radiating
                    effect.

            <div class="section1-item3">
                <img src="Transitional typographical system2-01.png"
            style="width:400px;height:400px;">
                <p>Transitional Typographical System</p>
                <p>This type of typographical system is made using almost no structure, mainly
                    made by lines being drawn and then on top of that a design is made using
                    those lines as a guide. This can reflect movement in the graphic piece
                    as well. You can see this reflected in mine as I have drawn lines and edited
                    the text along the lines as well as showing a clear structure downwards so
                    your eye will start at the top (the most important information) and go down
                    from there.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section1-item4">
                <img src="Bilateral typographical system2-01.png"
            style="width:400px;height:400px;">
                <p>Bilateral Typographical System</p>
                <p>This type of typographical system is made using centered text and then from
                    there you have to edit elements around the text itself to help bring out
                    the design that you were looking for, often using asymmetry. You can see this
                    in my design since I have centered the text and the box around it has been
                    moved away from the text to create a more abstract look.
