                <p>Overall looking back at the coding tasks I found them challenging but they were very
                    useful. The first worksheets where I created my Pizza Party website this helped me understand
                    first how I can link between pages and as well as this gain control over the styles part of
                    my page eg. adding images/changing text and font. It also gave me a introductory basic
                    understanding of how to layout a page properly on the html and furthermore linking to css.
                    My next worksheet I added a link which then linked to a cake page which showed me how
                    to correctly import images into the html coding and then control the size and orientation
                    of the said image. This was also done without losing any quality of the image, it also
                    showed how to add a footer and use things such as the paragraph command and header commands
                    creating a container. My final worksheets were done on a "Flexbox Rundown" page, which
                    as the name states showed how to create and use flexboxes effectively. This was very useful
                    because this changes the whole layout of the page and how a page can look is determined by what
                    style choice that you have made within this. In this it also has a video imported into it which
                    I have demonstrated use of in my own website on my UX page. These skills I have learnt I have
                    put into my own website in multiple locations such as my main page where I have converted images
                    into links for my other webpages and such. I have also shown use of header understanding and
                    adjusting things in the body of the page by creating a div class command and altering in the CSS
                    coding page.
